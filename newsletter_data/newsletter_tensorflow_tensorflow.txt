There are also discussions about the need for better documentation and testing from the TensorFlow team, as well as the potential for these issues to be fixed in future releases.
   - Number of comments: 158

2. [**Bug - pip install tflite-model-maker fails or hangs forever**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/60431): This issue is about the failure or indefinite hanging of the `pip install tflite-model-maker` command in Google Colab, which prevents users from installing the package necessary for TensorFlow Lite model making. The problem persists across different attempts and configurations, including using nightly builds and various installation commands, and is exacerbated by dependency conflicts and version mismatches.

-   The comments section reveals that many users are experiencing the same issue, with some reporting that the installation process fills up the storage space and others noting dependency conflicts. Various workarounds, such as downgrading Python versions or using alternative installation methods, have been suggested but with limited success. The TensorFlow team has acknowledged the issue and recommended using the MediaPipe Model Maker as an alternative, although this does not fully address the needs of all users.
   - Number of comments: 135

3. [**cuDNN, cuFFT, and cuBLAS Errors**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/62075): This issue is about errors and warnings encountered when running a GPU test with TensorFlow, specifically related to the inability to load cuDNN, cuFFT, and cuBLAS libraries, which affects the speed of training neural networks. The user is running TensorFlow on WSL2 Linux Ubuntu 22 with an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1660 Ti GPU and has tried various solutions without success.

- The comments discuss various attempts to resolve the issue, including reinstalling TensorFlow with the `tensorflow[and-cuda]` package, downgrading TensorFlow versions, and adjusting CUDA and cuDNN installations. Some users report partial success or workarounds, while others continue to face the same errors. The issue persists across different environments and configurations, with some users noting that the errors do not prevent GPU usage but may impact performance. The discussion also touches on potential bugs in TensorFlow's handling of these libraries and the need for a more permanent fix.
   - Number of comments: 126

4. [**How can I clear GPU memory in tensorflow 2?**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36465): This issue is about a user experiencing difficulties with TensorFlow 2.1.0 where GPU memory is not being released after model training, causing subsequent models to fail due to out-of-memory errors. The user has tried various solutions found online, but none have worked, and the only way to release the GPU memory is by restarting the computer.

-   The comments discuss various suggestions and workarounds, including using `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()`, limiting GPU memory growth, running training in separate processes, and using the `cuda_malloc_async` allocator. Despite these suggestions, many users report that the issue persists, and some have switched to other frameworks like PyTorch due to this unresolved problem.
   - Number of comments: 120

5. [**Feature Request: GPUOptions for Go binding**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/22926): This issue is a feature request to add GPUOptions for the Go binding in TensorFlow, as the current implementation does not allow specifying options for `NewSession`. The problem is that the GPUOptions struct is in an internal package, and `go generate` does not work for the protobuf directory, making it impossible to specify GPUOptions.

   - The comments discuss the need for a Go API to configure TensorFlow sessions, with suggestions for implementation and a pull request that was later reverted. Many users express interest in contributing, ask for guidance, and discuss the issue's status, with some confusion about whether it is still open.
